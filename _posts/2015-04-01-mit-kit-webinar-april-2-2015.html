excerpt: "We've been asked to present our work on Ceptr via an MIT webinar as &nbsp;part
  of their (Kerberos and Internet Trust) series highlighting notable&nbsp;new technologies.
  &nbsp;You can find the event&nbsp;<a href=\"http:&#47;&#47;kit.mit.edu&#47;seminars&#47;2015&#47;kit-webinar-series-april-2015\"
  target=\"_blank\">on the MIT web <&#47;a>site, and participate. We'll post a recording
  to this site afterward.\r\n\r\nWe've been building all kinds of low-level underlying
  tech in Ceptr, but it's hard to make that kind of stuff visible to an end-user rather
  than a programmer. For this call, so that people can actually <strong>see<&#47;strong>&nbsp;what's
  happening under the hood, we've created some video demos and some visualization
  interfaces to render the underlying semantic trees in a web-browser via JavaScript.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a preview of some of what we'll be showing.\r\n\r\n"

<p>We've been asked to present our work on Ceptr via an MIT webinar as &nbsp;part of their (Kerberos and Internet Trust) series highlighting notable&nbsp;new technologies. &nbsp;You can find the event&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;kit.mit.edu&#47;seminars&#47;2015&#47;kit-webinar-series-april-2015" target="_blank">on the MIT web <&#47;a>site, and participate. We'll post a recording to this site afterward.</p>
<p>We've been building all kinds of low-level underlying tech in Ceptr, but it's hard to make that kind of stuff visible to an end-user rather than a programmer. For this call, so that people can actually <strong>see<&#47;strong>&nbsp;what's happening under the hood, we've created some video demos and some visualization interfaces to render the underlying semantic trees in a web-browser via JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here's a preview of some of what we'll be showing.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-33"></a></p>
<p><strong>DEMO:<&#47;strong> The first demo is Ceptr-like, not actually Ceptr, it is of H.O.P.E (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.higherorderprogramming.com&#47;" target="_blank">Higher Order Programming<&#47;a> Environment) built by Marc Clifton using&nbsp;receptor and membrane computing similar to Ceptr. &nbsp;Marc has also been building C# interfaces in Windows directly on top of our code from github, but this video he recorded helps&nbsp;you see the kinds of interactions receptors have.</p>

<p><strong>Ceptr RunTrees:<&#47;strong> Eric also made a recording showing how the underlying semantic trees in Ceptr which store data and code, can be used as a kind of semantic stack which "eats itself" as it processes leaving behind the result of the processing.</p>

<p>We're building all of these things into a Prezi for the call (which we'll post here as well when we're done building it).</p>
<p>Enjoy this opportunity to <strong>see<&#47;strong> what's going on inside all this low-level code. :)</p>
