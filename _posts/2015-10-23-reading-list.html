<p>People have been asking how they can find out more about Ceptr... What it is... How it works... etc.  There are a few layers of answers to this question. The first is that we need to publish more, but nonetheless, there's some pretty substantial stuff for those who want to dig in.</p>
<ul>
<li>The quickest overview is our <a href="http://ceptr.org/2015/09/24/mitkit-ceptr-webinar/">MIT/KIT Webinar Demo</a> which shows how most things work at a reasonably low level.</li>
<li>Most important is the <a href="http://ceptr.org/revelation" target="_blank"><span class="il">Ceptr</span> Revelation</a>, which we want to keep expanding and updating as a not-quite-whitepaper.</li>
<li>There's our<a href="https://github.com/zippy/ceptr" target="_blank"> Github repo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zippy/ceptr/wiki" target="_blank">wiki</a> and <a href="http://zippy.github.io/ceptr/" target="_blank">Doxygen generated API documentation</a>.</li>
<li>There's <a href="http://artbrock.com/blog">Arthur's blog</a> and some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX5yoqegfLNw3__VSOPDdiayibXlE2XGLDapg-Bi3tc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Crypto-Currency related writing</a> differentiating our approach to BFT &amp; distributed apps from Blockchain.</li>
</ul></p>
<h2>And there's still HOPE</h2><br />
<a href="http://www.marcclifton.com/" target="_blank">Marc Clifton</a> is a very prolific and thorough technical writer who has written about <span class="il">Ceptr</span> &amp; HOPE (<a href="http://www.higherorderprogramming.com/developers-1-1-2/" target="_blank">Higher Order Programming Environment</a>). A bunch of the design of HOPE is connected to his interactions with us around <span class="il">Ceptr,</span> but is an environment he built on C# to play with. It has a number of differences, but is still a good way to see what <span class="il">Ceptr</span>-like stuff looks like in action.  The following articles are listed newest first (If you want to be thorough, you can start at the bottom of the list and work your way up.) This may actually be the largest  bulk of documentation about <span class="il">Ceptr</span> that exists so far, even though it's not precisely about <span class="il">Ceptr</span>.  Many of the articles have VIDEOS which really help see what it all looks like in action. Watch them!</p>
