# Holochain Hackathon

 **When:** March 6 - 8, 2017 <br />
 **Where:** San Francisco, CA <br />
 **How Much:** Food is provided. Some housing is available. <br />

 You can contact [Matthew Schutte](http://matthewschutte.com/about/) to arrange for housing and see if there is still availability. Some people are joining us in San Francisco as early as March 3rd to help prepare.

## What are we doing at the Hackathon?
**Building distributed applications on Holochains!**

We should be able to build apps in Lisp or JavaScript by that time. So we'll be building and testing the first prototype applications on Holochains.

**Examples:**
 - _**Distributed Slack-alike:**_ Do you slack chat team conversations without a central server. Implement a different holochain instance for each team.
 - _**Distributed Twitter**:_ Micro-post broadcasting without central server infrastructure
 - _**Distributed PKI**_ (Public Key Infrastructure): Finally, reliable  but decentralized infrastructure to share, search, find, validate public keys against contact information of individuals.
 - _**Personal Sync Chain**_ which publishes to larger Group Holochains: What if you want to have a handful of your devices synchronize with each other on a holochain, but present themselves as a unified address in groups you participate in?
 - _**Quantified Self Universal Logging**_ App: Log whatever you want to your personal data store.
 - _**Rating / Tagging / Feedback**_: Distributed way to assert metrics, semantics, and annotations on to any addressable / linkable item

What do you want to work on?
