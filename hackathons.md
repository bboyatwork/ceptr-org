# Holochain Hackathon

 **When:** March 6 - 8, 2017 <br />
 **Where:** San Francisco, CA <br />
 **How Much:** Food is provided. Some housing is available. <br />

 You can contact [Matthew Schutte](http://matthewschutte.com/about/) to arrange for housing and see if there is still availability. Some people are joining us in San Francisco as early as March 3rd to help prepare.

## What are we doing at the Hackathon?
**Building distributed applications on Holochains!**

We should be able to build apps in Lisp or JavaScript by that time. So we'll be building and testing the first prototype applications on Holochains.
