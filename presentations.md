# Holochain Presentation
<img class="fit responsive" src="/images/distributed-except-distributed.jpg">

*When:* Friday, April 28 at 12 PM - 2 PM PDT

*Where:* Online - [Link to Zoom Room](https://zoom.us/j/2094718416) - [Link to Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1883517225263014/)

*Further Details:*

Holochain is a next-gen technology platform that addresses many needs for secure communication and building peer-to-peer applications.Holochain goes far beyond the blockchain architecture, removing bottlenecks by creating independent, parallel chains, addressing social coherence, accountability and governance, and the ability to more rapidly evolve protocols. Billions of dollars are being thrown at blockchain right now, even for projects that would be much better served by Holochain.

World of Distributed Applications and Decentralized Currencies

- Holochain is a platform for building, launching, and distributing applications which run as a peer-to-peer system without central servers or hosting.

- The Holochain Network runs in parallel with the Internet but is designed for secure, encrypted communications with rapidly evolving protocols.

- As an underlying communication and development infrastructure, the Holochain protocols must be open source and not privately owned.

- There is a huge demand for decentralized architectures for communications, applications and currencies evidenced by the most successful crowd-equity sales in history.

- People are clamoring for cooperative platforms to effectively share resources and create new commons. Think AirBnB or Uber, but without a central corporation extracting profits from using our homes or cars.

- Holochain uses similar cryptographic techniques as the blockchain for ensuring data integrity in a distributed system, but goes far beyond its capacities for processing and storage.

- Holochain removes the bottleneck of consensus on a shared ledger with human-centric design instead of coin or token-centric design.

- Once Holochain is ready for fuel it will also be ready for others to create Mutual-credit cryptocurrencies and ecosystems of interoperable current-sees (monetary and non-monetary)
