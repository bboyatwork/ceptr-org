## Overview


## Scapes
Collections of atomic data

Relational geometry

Two types of Scapes

Indexed - Internal Property

Assertion - External Relationship

## Listeners
Scapes have an asynchronous which follows data instance updates.

In the same way you can request data that matches a particular query, you can plant a standing request for changes to data that match a particular condition (specified in [Semtrex](/projects/pcubed))

Nodes can refuse to plant a listener, or throttle listeners to particular levels of processing or bandwidth. They can revoke listeners at any time. The ability to have an application on your side receive data when particular changes happen elsewhere on the network without needing to send a constant stream of requests will create fascinating new kinds of interwoven data dependencies.

It allows people and their devices to be connected in ways which completely mimic the neuronal structures and patterns of the brain and body.

## Distributed Indexing and Search
Listeners on a scape on a single node is one cool thing, and its not too complex once the structures exist to enable it. However, indexing distributed data and making it easily searchable and queriable is an issue on another scale.
