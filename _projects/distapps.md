## Overview
<em>**Stage of Development:** Waiting for [Holochain](/projects/holochain) development to reach Alpha 0.1 </em>

This sub-project is best understood as a development phase when we will be boot-strapping a number of applications using [Holochains](/projects/holochain) & [Pcubed](/projects/pcubed).  This will demonstrate composing with holochains and how that technology provides [edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing).

## Apps Ecosystem
These are some of the applications that support an edge-hosted application ecosystem, and that we want for our own project, so we will be developing them in this phase of the project.

- Distributed PKI
- Distributed Directories
- Rating/Tagging/Annotation
- Chat & Social posting
- Distributed Content Delivery Network
- A crypto-reputation-currency akin to a bit torrent sharing ratio
- A mutual-credit cryptocurrency for micro transactions and settlement of hosting imbalances.
