# Opportunities

Join a rapidly growing team and community of contributors. If you like our project and know you want to change the world with the kind of impact this work will have, then this page is for you.


## Current Opportunities

**Important Context:** This is an Open Source project building significantly disruptive tools. As such, it is not a profit-driven model and has no short-term revenue. Most people participate as volunteers.

However, we are putting in place value accounting for all types of participation, and there are many ways contributors can be rewarded. Also, we have received some financial support that we are carefully leveraging. [Learn about our operations](/operations).

 * [Ongoing Participation](#)

### Summer 2017 Residencies

*San Francisco CA ~ Ashland OR ~ Upstate NY*

**So you want to change the world?** ...but you're looking for the best way to get started...

We're building a team of world-changers across a variety of connected social enterprises and cool projects. We currently have multiple openings for interns and entry-level world-changers.

Projects you'd be working on:
 * Building the next economy
 * Developing alternative currencies and platforms
 * Innovating on collaboration tools
 * Building new commons
 * and more...

Opportunities include the ones listed in the [section below](#ongoing-partication)

This is no typical 9 to 5 grind. Many flexible arrangements are available, including telecommuting, part-time, full-time, residencies, internships, and travel opportunities.

Some roles are paid, some are unpaid, some may include room and board (just steps from the beach in San Francisco). All have the possibility of becoming paid based on satisfactory performance.

More important than specific job skills or experience is communication, competence and commitment. We can provide training and development on particular skills, although it is also great if you're already bringing some good ones.

If selected, this could easily become a career path as most will advance toward positions of leadership or take their training out into the world to start their own entrepreneurial ventures.

[Apply online here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRsdhzd1Wkfe0GA0_gfyJiuZ6bVUust5uLkZqDNeeO8G2wNg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
