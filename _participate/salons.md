## Ceptr Salons


<!-- toc orderedList:0 depthFrom:3 depthTo:6 -->

Our salons give us an opportunity to share ideas, explore them in conversation, meet new people and renew old friendships.

## UPCOMING SALONS
### The Future of Governance is not Governments
Metacurrency co-founder Arthur Brock argues that our governmental institutions don't have the bandwidth to keep up with a world that is changing as rapidly as ours is and suggests that we need to create new governance mechanisms using bottom-up, digital social networks.  

The article is a short read. Please bring comments or questions to the online salon so we can explore this terrain together.

### The Right to be Forgotten
Sunday May 13th, 2017

Inspired by Maciej Cegłowski’s recent suggestion that we “teach social software to forget, to give it predictable security properties, and to sever the financial connection between online advertising and extremism.” (http://idlewords.com/talks/build_a_better_monster.htm)
